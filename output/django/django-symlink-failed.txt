It turns out that the symlink finagling for django happened without Python 3.11 being in place.
This meant the django stuff failed with no good Python, and apparently never undid the finagling, so 
everything else broke. Below are the details.


 a broken yum --
-bash: /usr/bin/yum: cannot execute: required file not found
--
so I would have to figure out where to get python with rpm to be able 
to do anything. The image is
Amazon Linux 2023 AMI 2023.0.20230329.0 x86_64 HVM kernel-6.1
